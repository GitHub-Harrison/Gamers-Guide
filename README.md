# Gamers Guide
Gamers Guide is a site that aims to provide as much help as possible to getting newer players up to speed on one of my favourite games Apex Legends. The site will target gamers that are new to Apex Legends to try and speed them along the learning curve - which for a battle royale game like Apex, can be brutal - as a gamer myself I understand that if you don't enjoy the first few hours/days of a new game you are unlikely to play it again. Gamers Guide will be useful for these new players to understand more about the game and how it was designed to be played before even having to go through the annoyance of dying over and over again without knowing what to change to survive longer.

## Wireframes

Before I started any of the coding I first created some wireframes for how I wanted the project to roughly look.

* __Landing Page Wireframe__
    * At first I thought of having a landing page for the user to land on which would welcome them to the site and explain what the purpose of the site was, I then decided that I no longer thought a landing page was needed.

![Landing Page Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/landing-page.png)

* __Home Page Wireframe__
    * The home page was going to have a simple layout with just some basic information about the game Apex Legends and a video of the official launch trailer.

![Home Page Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/home.png)

* __Characters Page Wireframe__
    * The plan for the character page was to have all the characters currently in the game displayed so the user could see what each characters base model looked like and have the characters name under each image.

![Characters Page Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/characters.png)

* __Weapons Page Wireframe__
    * The weapons page was going to follow a similar style to the characters page but it would also have the weapon attachments displayed underneath the weapons in either a table or grid layout.

![Weapons Page Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/weapons.png)

* __Items Page Wireframe__ 
    * The item page would also follow the previous two pages layout except would be displaying all items in the game.

![Items Page Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/items.png)

* __Guide Page Wireframe__
    * The guide page idea was going to have a basic starter guide for the users to quickly understand how the game works as well as tips to help them improve quicker.

![Guide Page Wireframe](/documentation/wireframes/guide.png)

## Features

* __Navigation Bar__
    * Featured in the top right of all pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home, Characters, Weapons, Items, Maps and Feedback page and each bar is identical across the pages. Clicking the logo on the top left of the page will also take the user back to the Home page.

    * This feature will allow the user to navigate around the site with ease without having to use the 'back' button to visit the previous page.

![Navigation Bar](/documentation/readme/screenshots/navigation-bar-screenshot.png)

* __Hero Image__
    * The hero image for all my pages is an image taken from a google search and has been placed in a way that the characters heads are not visible.
    * I have chosen this image as its style matches the style of the images for the characters on the character page.

![Hero Image](/documentation/readme/screenshots/hero-image.png)

* __What is Apex Legends?__
    * The what is apex legends section provides an overview of what the game is all about, when it launched, what platforms you can currently play it on and how many people approximately play the game.
    * There is also a video of the offical launch trailer of the game taken directly from their youtube channel, this provides people who are yet to play the game a quick inside look of what they can expect.
    
![What is Apex Legends](/documentation/readme/screenshots/what-is-apex-legends.png)

* __Apex Legends Beginner Guide__
    * The beginners guide consists of many subsections which cover various different points which all combined teach you how to increase your chances at winning each match and how to improve.
    * The user will also have the choice to play another video which is a more indepth trailer of the game that covers a lot more than the original launch trailer does. This also came directly from their official youtube channel.

![Apex Legends Beginner Guide](/documentation/readme/screenshots/guide.png)

* __Choose the Legend Who Matches Your Playstyle__
    * This section gives a brief overview of how different characters have different playstyles and it's up to you as the player to decide who your squad needs and which character will compliment the way you play.

![Choose the Legend Who Matches Your Playstyle](/documentation/readme/screenshots/playstyle.png)

* __Stay Close to Your Squad__
    * The stay close to your squad subsection explains how important teamplay is in Apex Legends and how the right legends with the right teamwork can allow you to quickly increase the chances of victory.

![Stay Close to Your Squad](/documentation/readme/screenshots/squad.png)

* __Use Smart Comms to Keep in Touch with Your Teammates__
    * This subsection helps the user understand how the in game ping system can help your teammates see what you see and vice versa, this is especially important when you are not playing with your friends.

![Smart Comms](/documentation/readme/screenshots/smart-comms.png)

* __Get Familiar with the Arena__
    * The get familiar with the arena subsection explains how the map you play on changes every few hours except for the ranked mode. 
    * The user will learn that it's better to learn a few areas on a map at a time to make it less overwhelming to learn the whole map in the long run.

![Familiar with the Arena](/documentation/readme/screenshots/familiar-with-arena.png)

* __Go for the Good Stuff, But Be Careful__
    * Go for the good stuff, teaches the user that there are some areas within each map that consistently spawns good tier gear for them to use, but the better the loot the more people that will drop there.
    * The user also learns that you start each match with limited equipment so landing at the right spot is important if you're going for the win.

![Go for the Good Stuff, But Be Careful](/documentation/readme/screenshots/good-stuff.png)

* __Revive and Respawn Your Teammates__ 
    * Revive and Respawn your teammates explains to the user that even if you go down or die there is still a chance for you to come back as long as one member of your squad survives.

![Revive and Respawn Your Teammates](/documentation/readme/screenshots/revive-respawn.png)

* __Use Jump Towers, Hot Zones, and Other Features to Your Advantage__
    * This section helps the user understand that the maps consist of many other features that you might not be told about when you first launch the game,
    * The user can use this information to improve their game sense and implement their understanding of these features into their own matches.

![Use Jump Towers, Hot Zones, and Other Features to Your Advantage](/documentation/readme/screenshots/jump-tower.png)

* __Don't Let Anything Go to Waste__
    * Don't let anything go to waste explains to the user that you can find loot throughout the map and to always check caches/supply bins that are located throughout the map.
    * This also teaches the user that the inventory system will automatcially tell you if the gear you're looking at it better than what you currently have as well as other useful information.

![Don't Let Anything Go to Waste](/documentation/readme/screenshots/waste-nothing.png)

* __Download Now Button__

    * The footer section only includes the name of the site, with a scroll to top button that appears once you have scrolled down the page a certain amount.
    * The scroll to top button appears about 3/4 on the footer and 1/4 off.

![Footer](/documentation/readme/screenshots/footer.png)

* __Characters__ 
    * This section contains several grids under a short paragraph that gives a little information into how you get the characters.
    * I have kept this text short so the user can focus on seeing what the characters looks like and doesn't have too much to read, especially after all the text on the first page.

![Characters](/documentation/readme/screenshots/characters.png)

* __Offensive Legends__
    * This is the first grid showing what the offensive characters in apex legends look like.
    * The layout of this page allows the user to get an idea of what characters might fit their playstyle before they even load up the game. (A more aggresive player would usually lean towards one of these characters)

![Offensive Legends](/documentation/readme/screenshots/offensive-characters.png)

* __Recon Legends__
    * The next section is similar to the previous except it is showcasing the recon legends within the game.
    * These characters would fit a player who likes to gather information befoew deciding what to do next.

![Recon Legends](/documentation/readme/screenshots/recon-characters.png)

* __Defensive Legends__
    * This section follows the recon legends grid and is also its own grid showcasing what the defensive legends look like with their names under their image.
    * A player who likes to hold down and defend an area would benefit from using one of these characters.

![Defensive Legends](/documentation/readme/screenshots/defensive-characters.png)

* __Support Legends__
    * This is the final grid for showcasing the characters, it follows the same style as the previous ones.
    * If the user prefers a supporting role on a team then they are more likely to play either of these support legends which are orientated around helping the team.

![Thank You Page](/documentation/readme/screenshots/thanks.png)

## Testing

Whenever I add a new section or feature to a page before I add or commit the change I will first check that it works correctly and as planned in the browser.

All the navigation works on all pages and has had no issues even with adding more pages.

I have not discovered any bugs while creating this website, however, I did have some problems while trying to create the landing page for the website. After spending several hours on trying to get the landing page working as planned I decided to ditch the landing page idea.

None of the videos start playing until the user clicks on the video, all videos work as planned.

The feedback page inputs work as planned and when the user presses the submit button it takes them to a thank you page which has a return to home button which also works correctly. The only problem at the moment is the feedback can be submitted without being filled in.

## Validator Testing

* HTML
    * No errors showing when I ran the code through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub-harrison.github.io%2FGamers-Guide%2F)

![HTML Validator](/documentation/validator/html-validator.png)

* CSS
    * No errors were found when I ran my code through the official [(Jigsaw) Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub-harrison.github.io%2FGamers-Guide%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en).

![CSS Validator](/documentation/validator/css-validator.png)

## Unfixed Bugs

* I have not come across any bugs.

## Browser Compatibility

* When testing my site on different browsers I have noticed that on the Brave browser the smooth scroll to top does not work as intended but instead snaps to the top of the page, where as on all other browsers it is a smooth scroll to the top. 

## Deployment

* The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the settings tab
    * From the settings tab scroll down until you see the 'pages' tab on the left.
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the main branch
    * Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Here is the list of sources I used: 

__Code__
* For code that wasn't written by myself
    * https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp - This helped me create a more responsive navigation as mine become muddled when being viewed on a smaller screen.

__Content__

I used many different websites as well as the game to help fill my website with content. None of the images or videos are mine and I have taken them from the sites/links listed below. As for the text, majority of the text was also taken from these links with some minor changes as some of the information was outdated.

The sites I used for my content:

* Text
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_Legends - Text was used in the first section "What is Apex Legends" on the Index page
    * https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/apex-legends-beginners-guide-tips-and-tricks - Text was used for the "Beginners Guide" section on the Index page
    * https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/maps#battle-royale - Text was used on the Maps page to give backstory to the maps

* Videos - All videos were taken from YouTube

The majority of the text that was used from the above websites has been used on the Index/Home page as well as the Maps page. The text content on the other pages is information that every player of Apex Legends has available to them by loading up the game and viewing the items/attachments within the game.

Some of the text taken and used on the Index/Home page was slightly outdated as there has been many updates to the game and not all of the sites I used have been kept up to date so I made some minor changes to the text but for the most part the text was taken from those links above.

The screenshots taken on the items and weapons page were taken from my game account and cropped/merged in Photoshop.
