            <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and
                published by Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in
                February 2019, and for Nintendo Switch in March 2021. A mobile version of the game specially designed
                for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile has also been announced which is scheduled to be fully
                released by 2022 on Android and iOS. The game now also supports cross-platform play.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Before the match, players form into two or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed characters
                with distinctive abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay modes. In "Battle Royale", up
                to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies
                before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks
                over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be
                fatal. The final team alive wins the round.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>In the most recent mode "Arenas", players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad
                in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when
                their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Apex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series.
                Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained a secret right up until its launch.
                The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it had been assumed that Respawn
                Entertainment was working on a third installment to the Titanfall franchise, the studio's previous major
                game. Apex Legends received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, progression system,
                and fusion of elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy competitor to other battle
                royale games. Apex Legends surpassed 25 million players by the end of its first week, and 50 million
                within its first month. By April 2021, it had approximately 100 million players.

            <h4>Choose the Legend Who Matches Your Playstyle</h4>

            <p>In the Apex Arena, all competitors are equals, and the Legends are evenly matched in terms of strength, speed, and firepower. 
                It’s their abilities that set them apart, so you’ll want to pick the Legend that matches your preferred playstyle and complements your squad.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Want to be the shield between your team and opponents? Jump into the arena as the hearty Gibraltar. 
                How about helping your squad travel long distances to take your enemies by surprise? Pathfinder, with his trusty grappling hook, is your perfect pick. 
                Is supporting your team with health boosts more your style? Lifeline is ready for action. 
                Figure out what role you like to play and try different Legends to see which fits you best.
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <h4>Stay Close to Your Squad</h4>

            <p>Squadplay is critical to success in Apex Legends, where you jump into the arena with two teammates at your side. Working together, 
                you can keep each other safe and outplay your opponents by combining your abilities. 
                A well-placed Dimensional Rift by Wraith, for example, can put her team right on top of unsuspecting opponents, 
                while Caustic can protect teammates by using Nox gas to drive away enemies.
            </p>

            <p>Try to strike out on your own, and you'll be up against other teams who can easily overwhelm you. 
                Stick close to your squad, and you’ll have a greater chance at success.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h4>Use Smart Comms to Keep in Touch with Your Teammates</h4>

            <br>
            
            <p>You can give your teammates critical information – and vice versa – through an in-game system that lets you ping useful items and locations on their screens. </p>
            
            
            <p>You can pinpoint the position of gear pieces (and what they are), highlight threats, 
                and tell your teammates which direction you’re going before you’ve even plugged in a microphone. 
                Use this to your advantage to make sure your teammates see what you see and always have the latest intel.
            </p>
